			<h2>Chatbox Guide</h2>
			<h3>Running the app</h3>
			You can download it from Chatbox homepage and then usually a simple double-click will run the app.
			If not, then you'll need to configure your Java setting because this app is using Java (.jar format)<br />
			Chatbox has not been tested among various OS, currently only tested using Windows XP, so it might not work properly if you're using Mac or Linux
			<h3>Getting Started</h3>
			To start using Chatbox, you will need to register your account. It's only a simple 3-step way:
			<ol>
			<li>Open Chatbox, go to "Register" tab and fill in your details<br />

			<li>An activation code will be sent to your e-mail</li>
			<li>Enter the activation code into "Activate" tab<br />

			<ul>
			<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Chatting</span>: One of the main features of Chatbox is of course to chat. Just type in the typing box, and press ENTER to send your message.</li>
			<li>You can see who are online in the list on the left and can click on one of the user's names to chat privately with him/her.</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Displaying LaTeX</span>: And to display the LaTeX, just enclose your LaTeX command with dollars sign ($), like in the image above.</li>
			<li>For those who are familiar with displaying LaTeX on forums, this is done in exactly the same way</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Message history</span>: You can also see your previous sent messages (up to 50 messages) by pressing up in the typing box</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Keyboard shortcut</span>: To change the user you want to talk to, just press CTRL+UP or CTRL+DOWN to change the user</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Saving messages</span>: You can save the message window into a file by going to File->Save current window. This will save the rendered LaTeX images as code</li>
			</ul>
